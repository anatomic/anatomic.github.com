If you've never used InDesign then these are pretty much bread and butter layout tools for type and they are pretty damn good.  The only trouble with them is that once you've used them, you really want them in Photoshop (and Illustrator for that matter).</p>

<p>Doing web work I find that Photoshop really is the best app available for layout and graphical treatment, I love it!  However, I don't love editing text in it, and I certainly don't like trying to change the styling of several areas of text manually.  If only it had some of the awesome text features that come with InDesign, web work would be so much faster!</p>

<p>I guess it's another little dream to add to the pile of "one day maybe?"</p></div><hr class="rule" data-reactid=".lc87iiatxc.2"><p class="smallprint" data-reactid=".lc87iiatxc.3"><span data-reactid=".lc87iiatxc.3.0">Â©</span><span data-reactid=".lc87iiatxc.3.1">2014</span><span data-reactid=".lc87iiatxc.3.2"> Ian Thomas</span></p></div>
