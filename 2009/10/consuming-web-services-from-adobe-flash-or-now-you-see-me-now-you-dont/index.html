<pre><code>I wonder if I'm missing something here. Today I tried to setup a flash widget to bring in a feed from Twitter, in the Flash IDE this was, of course, no problem.  I got the data, parsed it and displayed it just how I wanted.  This wasn't quite the case when I deployed to the web (of course).  I was greeted by the usual security error when trying to pull in data from another domain.
</code></pre>

<p>Freely admitting that I'm not so hot on the intricate details of the Flash security sandbox, I guess this means that Twitter doesn't have a cross domain policy file (seems strange).  So I did the obvious thing, wrote some php that pulled the feed from Twitter so that my little Flash app thought it was coming from my domain.</p>

<p>This little song and dance seems crazy to me, why not just let me get at that xml in the first place? </p>

<p>I can tell a good few hours reading up on this is required, but it just puzzled me.  The solution was easy enough but it seems wholly unecessary.</p>
