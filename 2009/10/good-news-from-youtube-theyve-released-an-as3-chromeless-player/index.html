<pre><code>Youtube have just announced ([http://apiblog.youtube.com/2009/10/actionscript-3-youtube-chromeless.html](http://apiblog.youtube.com/2009/10/actionscript-3-youtube-chromeless.html)) the release of the AS3 version of their chromeless player.  This is brilliant news as it means that integrating Youtube video in my projects just lost a massive pain in the arse!! 
</code></pre>

<p>A recent project for I worrked on for The Science Museum (London) required Youtube integration and I can honestly say that working with an AS3 - AS2 wrapper and the general fiddle that was getting everything talking to each other made it one of the most frustrating jobs I've done in a while.  One particularly brilliant gotcha was that even if your code was right, you couldn't check if everything was working until you previewed the swf in a browser, which is crackers!!  The sigh of relief was huge when it all worked, as Youtube integration adds some pretty cool stuff to any project!</p>

<p>This announcement is another nudge to the 'old-school' AS2 developers that they should probably start using AS3.  The AS2 API isn't going anywhere for a few years, but it is officially deprecated so perhaps it's the gentle push that people need to get them using the latest version of the Actionscript language.</p>
