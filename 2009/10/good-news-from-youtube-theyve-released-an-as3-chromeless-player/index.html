</code></pre>

<p>A recent project for I worrked on for The Science Museum (London) required Youtube integration and I can honestly say that working with an AS3 - AS2 wrapper and the general fiddle that was getting everything talking to each other made it one of the most frustrating jobs I've done in a while.  One particularly brilliant gotcha was that even if your code was right, you couldn't check if everything was working until you previewed the swf in a browser, which is crackers!!  The sigh of relief was huge when it all worked, as Youtube integration adds some pretty cool stuff to any project!</p>

<p>This announcement is another nudge to the 'old-school' AS2 developers that they should probably start using AS3.  The AS2 API isn't going anywhere for a few years, but it is officially deprecated so perhaps it's the gentle push that people need to get them using the latest version of the Actionscript language.</p></div><hr class="rule" data-reactid=".5lkl138ni8.2"><p class="smallprint" data-reactid=".5lkl138ni8.3"><span data-reactid=".5lkl138ni8.3.0">©</span><span data-reactid=".5lkl138ni8.3.1">2014</span><span data-reactid=".5lkl138ni8.3.2"> Ian Thomas</span></p></div>
