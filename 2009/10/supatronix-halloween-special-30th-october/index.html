<pre><code>Supatronix is bouncing back after the recent closure by Hackney Council of its home for the past year Herbal by moving a short walk down Old Street to The Courtyard.
</code></pre>

<p>It's a masive shame that Herbal has been closed as it was a great club for a breaks party - small and lively with a great soundsystem.</p>

<p>Never to be downtrodding, Supatronix will march on, spreading the word of breaks across East London and starts it's time in the new gaff with a headline set from Future Funk Squad.</p>

<p>Glen's got a treat in store for the first 50 lucky punters as he's agreed to give each of them a copy of his latest album, absolutely free.</p>

<p>As usual I've chipped in my little bit of help by putting together some flyers for the event.</p>
