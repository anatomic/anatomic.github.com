Flash, however, is an excellent environment to get into generative art as coding on the timeline can be loose and fast, with no need to get into classes and objects (unless you want to).  I think the term is 'sketching' and it's a good way to think of this sort of coding.  It's coding for designers, not developers.

If you've never used InDesign then these are pretty much bread and butter layout tools for type and they are pretty damn good.  The only trouble with them is that once you've used them, you really want them in Photoshop (and Illustrator for that matter).",
