    <p>Perhaps “New Adventures” is the wrong phrase as I’m now well into my third month of this particular endeavour, but sticking with the theme I’m pleased to announce that I am now Head of Digital for <a href="http://www.finncomms.com">Finn</a>! It’s a bit of a departure from working for a web design agency (for those that don’t know, Finn are traditionally known as a PR agency) but it’s a grand adventure and one that I’m excited to be part of.</p>

    <p>Yesterday saw the second New Adventures in Web Design, organised by Simon Collison (Colly) and Greg Wood. In his editorial piece in the conference newspaper, Colly said he'd vowed "never again" after last year's conference, but that he was talked into doing it all over again by Greg over a few jars of ale. Thanks Greg, you were right to bully Colly as it would have been criminal if this fantastic event hadn't happened again.</p>

    <p>If you are anything like me you often find yourself pondering the best way to get something done. That something could be how to grow the nicest lawn, ride the perfect line down a rocky trail, pour the perfect pint or write the most semantically sound HTML and CSS. Ok, so maybe they are just me, but certainly one of the things that commands my attention more often than not is the web design process.</p>

    <p>Google Analytics has recently introduced Social Interaction Tracking, a way to record and measure user interactions with social media buttons.  While it has been possible to track social interactions using Events, there is now a dedicated section that makes analysing Social actions even easier.

    <p>Up until recently I've not had much of a chance to play with generative art, though it's something that I've meaning meaning to check out for ages.  I've looked into Processing and had a little play with NodeBox before, but have never really used Flash in this capacity.  Flash, however, is an excellent environment to get into generative art as coding on the timeline can be loose and fast, with no need to get into classes and objects (unless you want to).  I think the term is 'sketching' and it's a good way to think of this sort of coding.  It's coding for designers, not developers.  Quick (and dirty) little scripts with no regard for performance that solely exist to produce interesting (if not beautiful) graphical output.</p>
