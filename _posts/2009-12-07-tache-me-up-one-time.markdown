For our christmas party at Coolpink we were heading out to the Casino so Leigh and myself thought the only way to achieve true gentleman status was to sport a moustache. 

I think this post serves more as an acute reminder to never again grow a 'tache than as a cheap laugh at my own expense! 

It's truly awful.
