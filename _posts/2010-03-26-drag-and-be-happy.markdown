Inspired by Erik Natzke this is an experiment with particles and chains to produce some pretty patterns!<!-- more -->

This effect is created by using the graphics API to draw the particles and then draw straight lines linking them.Â  Moving the mouse causes the particles to chase each other (and the mouse) and easing is applied to allow for some interesting shapes to be made.




Each frame is drawn to a bitmap which is made slight more transparent each frame to create the fade effect.




The next step is adding in width to the line to create a ribbon effect and I'll be posting that up soon!
