    Youtube have just announced ([http://apiblog.youtube.com/2009/10/actionscript-3-youtube-chromeless.html](http://apiblog.youtube.com/2009/10/actionscript-3-youtube-chromeless.html)) the release of the AS3 version of their chromeless player.  This is brilliant news as it means that integrating Youtube video in my projects just lost a massive pain in the arse!! 

A recent project for I worrked on for The Science Museum (London) required Youtube integration and I can honestly say that working with an AS3 - AS2 wrapper and the general fiddle that was getting everything talking to each other made it one of the most frustrating jobs I've done in a while.  One particularly brilliant gotcha was that even if your code was right, you couldn't check if everything was working until you previewed the swf in a browser, which is crackers!!  The sigh of relief was huge when it all worked, as Youtube integration adds some pretty cool stuff to any project!

This announcement is another nudge to the 'old-school' AS2 developers that they should probably start using AS3.  The AS2 API isn't going anywhere for a few years, but it is officially deprecated so perhaps it's the gentle push that people need to get them using the latest version of the Actionscript language.
