Sounds really exciting doesn't it but what you see below you is the result of little experiment to see how many particles my computer could handle at a decent frame-rate. I got up to 75 000 before it started to chug but for the sake of demonstration the following example only has 40 000 so that the majority of people can have a decent viewing experience.

Although coded by myself, the idea takes inspiration from an example on the great site [www.flashandmath.com](http://www.flashandmath.com) - Perlin Noise Accelerated Particles ([http://www.flashandmath.com/flashcs4/storm/index.html)](http://www.flashandmath.com/flashcs4/storm/index.html))

I'll post up some of my code later once I've given it a tidy up.
