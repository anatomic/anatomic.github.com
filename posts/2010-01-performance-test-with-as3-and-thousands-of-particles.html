<p>I've never experimented with using bitmapData and the copyPixels() method to increase performance when animating a large number of particles so I thought I'd have a quick play to see what could be achieved. </p>

<p>This demo has 2000 particles that bounce off the walls, have gravity and friction and are given a small motion blur and it manages a nice 24/25 fps (see the stats). <!-- more --></p>

<p>As I said above, this is a first proper experiment where I've tried to bypass the Flash Player vector renderer and I'm amazed by the results! </p>
